## Installation

### Use Prebuilt Binary

1. Install FFmpeg and add your ffmpeg bin to `PATH`
2. Download prebuilt binary from [here](https://github.com/ppodds/AAAAnimation/releases)

Caution:
Prebuilt binary conains Qt6's dependency, but you need to install FFmpeg by yourself.

### Compile From Source Code

#### Envirment

- Visual Studio 2019
  - Universal Windows Platform
  - C++ Desktop
  - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.1904)
  - Build Tools v142
  - Qt VS Tools (Extension)
- FFmpeg
  - [ffmpeg-n4.4.1-2-gcc33e73618-win64-lgpl-shared-4.4](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
- Qt
  - msvc 6.2.2
  - Windows

Caution:
you need to set Qt VS Tools's Qt Version to "Qt 6.2.2 for MSVC 2019"

#### Clone The Repository and Set Environment Variables

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ppodds/AAAAnimation.git
```

Environment Variables

- ffmpeg
  - `%your_project_path%\includes\ffmpeg`
- qt
  - `%your_qt_path%`
- PATH
  - `%qt%\bin;%ffmpeg%\bin%;...`

#### Build

Open `AAAAnimation.sln` and select build configuation (`Release`). Then build solution. You can see the result in `AAAAnimation\x64\Release\AAAAnimation.exe`.

If you want to deploy the binary, you can use qt's `windeployqt` tool in qt's console.

Change directory to `AAAAnimation\x64\Release` and run `windeployqt`

usage: `windeployqt AAAAnimation.exe`

This tool will copy dependencies to that folder and generate some files for deployment. Now you can run `AAAAnimation.exe` and enjoy it.

Caution:
`windeployqt` will not copy FFmpeg's dependencies to this folder. You need to copy them manually or add them to `PATH`.
